# Staying safe

Like any sport, sailing is not without risk. Ensure you have read and
understood this section, as common mistakes documented here can prevent injury.

# Persons over property

The safety of persons is of paramount importance, and always takes priority
over safety of property. If faced with any situation where either a person will
come to harm OR property will be damaged, *always* prioritize the safety of
persons. Things can be replaced, people can not.

A common mistake that beginners make is to try to stop a boat from coming into
contact with a piling or other vessel by using their feet, hands, or fingers.
The sheer momentum of these vessels will surprise you and will result in
injury, so use fenders instead of limbs.

# Secure footing and staying onboard

Staying onboard and preventing falls is critical on any yacht. Always follow
*"one hand for the boat, one hand for yourself"* as you move around on the
yacht. Stay low, move methodically, and avoid rushing, running, or jumping.
Quality sailing boots or shoes that provide adequate grip are important, but
need not expensive. Avoid stepping on lines or sails, as both are common causes
of slips or falls. Bad enough if you fall and hurt yourself, but worse to fall
overboard.

!!! note
    The majority of man overboard incidents happen in the harbor. Stay
    vigilant.

# Man Overboard (MOB)

In the event of a Man Overboard (MOB), we use the mnemonic *SPHERES* to help
remember the steps.

- S - Shout - Shout "Man Overboard!" so that everyone is aware of the situation.
- P - Point - Assign a person to point at the casualty and maintain constant
  visual contact. This person should never take their eyes off of the casualty
  in the water.
- H - Heave to (Munich manoevre) - This will slow the boat and give you time to
  assess the situation and act accordingly.
- E - Equipment thrown (Danbuoy, ring, lifeline) - Throw the floating
  horseshoe lifering to the casualty, even if they have a lifejacket. It will
  serve as a datum, a method of floatation, and may assist with hauling the
  casualty onboard.
- R - Radio (& ropework) - The skipper will use the VHF or delegate the crew to
  use VHF to inform the other KDY boats or indeed to call for assistance on VHF
  16, as appropriate. Tidy any ropes and prepare ropes that will be needed for
  recovery.
- E - Engine - Start the engine (if so equipped)
- S - Sails - (center the mainsail & furl, drop, luff, or use the headsail)

The skipper will decide the appropriate manoeuvre to position the yacht
alongside the casualty to recover them and the crew will recover the casualty.

!!! Warning
    If there is *any* doubt about a swift or safe recovery, call for assistance
    on VHF 16.

    An urgency message (to begin with the signal PAN-PAN) indicates that the
    station making it has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the safety
    of a ship or person. It may be prudent to use a PAN-PAN to let stations in
    the vicinity know that a person is in the water and that you are attempting
    recovery.

    The distress phase (to begin with MAYDAY) is *"a situation wherein there is
    reasonable certainty that a person, a vessel or other craft is threatened by
    grave and imminent danger and requires immediate assistance"*.

    __A man overboard at sea in anything but the calmest conditions or warmest
    waters is *almost always* at least an urgency (to notify nearby stations of the
    situation), and if a swift and safe recovery is in doubt, possibly a distress
    situation.__

# Cold Water Survival Times

Loss of dexterity and the ability to manipulate fingers, exhaustion or
unconsciousness, and death to drowning or hypothermia can happen more quickly
than most people realize if they are not familiar with cold water survival
times.

!!! Warning
    A casualty in the water with only a buoyancy aid (i.e., not a proper
    lifejacket designed to turn an unconcious casualty upright and keep their
    airway clear of the water) is almost certain to drown upon loss of
    conciousness.

| Water Temperature Degrees C | Water Temperature Degrees F | Loss of Dexterity | Exhaustion or Unconsciousness | Expected Time of Survival |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0.3 | 32.5 | Under 2 minutes | Under 15 minutes | Under 15 to 45 minutes |
| 0.3 to 4.5 | 32.5 to 40 | Under 3 minutes | 15 to 30 minutes | 30 to 90 minutes |
| 4.5 to 10 | 40 to 50 | Under 5 minutes | 30 to 60 minutes | 1 to 3 hours |
| 10 to 15.5 | 50 to 60 | 10 to 15 minutes | 1 to 2 hours | 1 to 6 hours |
| 15.5 to 21 | 60 to 70 | 30 to 40 minutes | 2 to 7 hours | 2 to 40 hours |
| 21 to 26.5 | 70 - 80 | 1 to 2 hours | 2 to 12 hours | 3 hours to indefinite |
| Over 26.5 | Over 80 | 2 to 12 hours | Indefinnite | Indefinite |

# The boom

The boom can always presents a potential danger as it comes across the deck of
the yacht. Make sure to always keep your head low and clear of the boom during
any tacking or gybing manoeuvres. Calling out "HEADS!" is a good way to remind
anyone not paying attention during a manoeuvre to keep low, so duck your head
low if you hear it.
