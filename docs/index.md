Purpose of This Site
This wiki serves as the central hub for all documentation related to the KDY International Sailing School. It is currently designed to support instructors and skippers by providing practical information about sailing procedures, harbor logistics, safety protocols, and teaching practices.

Whether you're preparing to teach a session, planning to sail a DS37, or looking to refresh your knowledge on school routines, you'll find what you need right here.

Who This Is For
Instructors & Skippers: You’ll find guidance on the sailing area, weather criteria, checklists, DS37 school boats, harbor maneuvers, and KDY practices.

Students: Browse general information about the marina and boats. 

This site is open to all members of the KDY International Sailing School community. While some content is technical or tailored to instructors, we hope to grow this wiki to eventually support all levels of sailors.

How to Use This Wiki
