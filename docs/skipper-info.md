# Sailing Area

The sailing area is limited to the Sound (Sundet), unless there is prior
authorization from sailing centre leadership, which will not be unduly refused.
The northern limit extends from Gilleleje harbour to Sweden (Kullen point
light). The southern limit extends in a line between Stevns Klint light and
Falsterbo reef light.
