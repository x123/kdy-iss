These differ whether the topmark is rounded clockwise (matchrace), or counter-clockwise (fleetrace). For matchracing, you're doing the spinnaker set on a port tack, for fleet racing on a starboard tack.</p> <p>The following describes the setup for matchracing; for fleet racing the setup is mirrored (i.e, pole on starboard, sail on port).</p> <ol> <li>Prepare the spinnaker below. Open the forward hatch on the bow deck, find    the head of the spinnaker, and run to both clews. This is to ensure that the    spinnaker is not twisted.</li> <li>Rig the barber haulers. They go through the small blocks by the side stays,    and through the small cleats by the cockpit. It should not matter if the jib    esheet crosses over or under (but this is often a personal preference). Don't    forget a figure-of-eight stopper knot at the end of the barber hauler lines.</li> <li> <p>Bring the spinnaker pole on deck, place it on the port side inside of the    side stays. Rig the uphaul.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>When rigging the spinnaker pole uphaul, make sure that the pole is under the port jib sheet, so that it can run freely (otherwise you'll have trouble getting out of the marina).</p> </li> <li> <p>Rig the spinnaker sheet. To easily get the headsail/spinnaker combination    right, put the headsail on the port side. The spinnaker sheet goes on    starboard from the block by the jib sheet winch to the back, crosses over    itself on the way forward (the spinnaker flies up, and the sheet flies up as    well), goes through the starboard barber hauler, passes the starboard shrouds    outside and goes to the spinnaker (starboard clew). Secure with a bowline, or    another knot of your choice.</p> </li> <li>Rig the guy. This mostly follows the spinnaker sheet: Go through the block    by the port jib sheet winch, to the back of the boat,    cross over itself, through the port barber hauler, outside of the shrouds,    around the front stay (outside of the sail!), and to the port clew of the    spinnaker. Ensure that the guy runs outside of the port jib sheet.</li> <li>Rig the spinnaker halyard. Make sure the halyard runs free (it tends to    entangle itself around the mast or stays), and mount it to the head of the    spinnaker, coming from starboard.</li> <li> <p>Decide whether you want figure-of-eight stopper knots in your spinnaker    sheets or not.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>If you choose to have knots at the end of the spinnaker sheets, it will not be possible to fully depower the spinnaker, and it may start pulling you in directions you don't want to go. If you don't have knots, you'll lose the spinnaker (it'll not be pulling you anywhere), but continuing to sail with it will be difficult. Racers tend to opt for knots, and cruisers as well as beginners on the spinnakers should not put knots in. You can also factor in crew knowledge and wind conditions, personally I'd opt for knots in light-wind conditions, and no knots outside of racing in heavier wind.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"sail-handling/#hoisting-the-spinnnaker","title":"Hoisting the spinnnaker","text":"<p>You can watch this video (in danish) for visuals of the process. This is again describing a matchrace-style set on a port tack, and assumes a standard racing crew setup with positions Skipper, mainsail, trimmer, tailer and bowman.</p> <ol> <li>Make sure that the spinnaker sheets are on the winches in the cockpit.</li> <li>(Bowman) Put the guy into the front hook of the pole. Ensure that you    take the line from the port side, not the starboard side that goes into the    hole! Take out the head and the clews of the sail onto the deck    (\"preloading the spinnaker\").</li> <li>(Tailer, Bowman) Hoist the pole until it's horizontal. The tailer pulls    the line in the cockpit (no winch needed!), the bowman clicks it in    the mast (racing: Set a mark on the uphaul for how far you need to pull it).    The port jib sheet has to run free if the pole is hoisted under the jib    sheet.</li> <li>(Trimmer) opens the barber hauler on the starboard side.</li> <li>(Everybody) Hoisting the spinnaker: Skipper holds a downwind course,    bowman is at the mast to pull the halyard, tailer pulls the halyard    at the pit. It is not put on a winch, but pumped to get it to the top.    Once the spinnaker is up, bowman announces \"top\".    The trimmer gets the sheet, mainsail gets the guy. Both pull these lines    appropriately while the spinnaker is raised, keeping the sail leewards    while it's being raised. When it's up, the guy is pulled in, while the sheet    is eased to rotate the sail towards port (aim for approximately keeping    the pole and the boom in a line). Once the sail is standing, the trimmer    takes over the guy from the mainsail.</li> <li>(Bowman, Tailer) Take down the foresail together, tailer opens the    cleat, bowman ensures it doesn't fall in the water and secures it on    deck with a sailtie.</li> <li>(Tailer) The tailer is now free to either take over the guy from mainsail    or from the trimmer, or to grind the spinnaker winches in close communication    with the trimmer. Either setup is possible, and depends on personal    preferences and skill level of trimmer and tailer.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sail-handling/#gybing-the-spinnaker","title":"Gybing the spinnaker","text":"<p>This assumes the same crew setup as above, and that the trimmer controls both the guy and the sheet, and the tailer grinds the spinnaker winches as required.

This is important even in racing,    where you might not hold a dead downwind course yet.</li> <li>(Tailer, Trimmer) The tailer pulls in the starboard barber hauler,    in communication with the trimmer. This stabilizes the sail, but might    require the trimmer to ease the sheet a bit to offset the shortening of    the line by the barber hauler.</li> <li>(Bowman) The bowman now unhooks the pole. It is important here to    unhook the sheet from the pole ASAP, as otherwise moving around the pole    will trim the sail in unintended ways, and might lead to the sail collapsing.    If you raised the pole with the port jib sheet hanging over it, now is the    time to take that off, so it goes under the pole.</li> <li>(skipper, trimmer, tailer, mainsail) Hold the boat stable on a downwind    course and the spinnaker flying. If the spinnaker collapses before the gybe    is completed, gybe back, get it flying, and start over.</li> <li>(Bowman) Cleat in the starboard spinnaker sheet into the front of the    pole. You ought to be able to grab it easily if the starboard barber hauler    is tight.</li> <li>(Skipper, Mainsail) Gybe the mainsail, be sure to let it out quickly,    otherwise the boat will point upwind, making gybing the spinnaker very hard.</li> <li>(Bowman) Stand stable with the back to the mast, push the pole forward    and out to the forestay. Don't push to the side, you'll not have the    strength to do that. Click the pole into the mast, and announce \"On\".</li> <li>(Trimmer, Tailer) Watch the bowman carefully. Follow with the guy    and ease it enough so that the bowman can get the pole all the way out.    Be very careful when you pull the guy in while the pole is    not clicked in the mast yet: It's very easy for you to make the job of the    bowman impossible.</li> <li>(Skipper) Keep the dead downwind course until the pole is in. If you go up    too early, your bowman will not have the strength to put in the pole.</li> <li>(Trimmer, Tailer) Once the pole is in, rotate over the spinnaker,    and trim it to course, by pulling in the guy, and easing the sheet.    Tailer releases the sheet barber hauler in communication with the trimmer.</li> <li>(Skipper) Sets a broad reach to beam reach course.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"sail-handling/#taking-down-the-spinnaker","title":"Taking down the spinnaker","text":"<p>The following description assumes that you have followed the previous instructions, done an uneven number of gybes (so you're on a starboard tack), and want to be able to hoist the spinnaker again on a port tack.

The design of the boat includes an oversized rudder and simple controls. The boat is popular as a teaching boat for beginners as well because of its simplicity and robustness. However, in Match racing, it is one of the most physically demanding boats found in the international match racing circuit.
